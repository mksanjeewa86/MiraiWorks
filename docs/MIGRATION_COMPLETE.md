## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Migration Complete** - Database schema is ready
2. ⏭️ **Test API Endpoints** - Use testing checklist in DEPLOYMENT_READY_CHECKLIST.md
3. ⏭️ **Create Test Data** - Create sample question banks and exams
4. ⏭️ **Test Workflow Integration** - Test full exam TODO workflow
5. ⏭️ **Deploy to Production** - Once testing is complete

---

## Notes

- The migration encountered a pre-existing `question_banks` table with slightly different schema
- This was resolved by stamping the base migration and creating a new migration for missing columns
- The `created_by` column in `question_banks` was successfully renamed to `created_by_id` for consistency
- All foreign key relationships are bidirectional and working correctly
- SAWarning about circular dependencies is expected and does not affect functionality (todos ↔ exam_assignments)

**Migration Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
