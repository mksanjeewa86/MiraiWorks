AUTHENTICATED FILE DOWNLOAD - FIXED

PROBLEM:
- User clicked file download link: http://localhost:8000/api/files/download/...
- Got error: {"detail":"Could not validate credentials"}
- Direct browser links don't include authentication headers

ROOT CAUSE:
- Simple <a href="..."> links don't send auth tokens
- Backend requires authentication for file downloads
- Browser requests don't include Authorization header

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:

1. REPLACED: Direct download links <a href="...">
   WITH: JavaScript download function <button onClick="...">

2. ADDED: handleFileDownload function that:
   - Gets auth token from localStorage
   - Makes authenticated fetch request
   - Downloads file as blob
   - Triggers browser download programmatically

3. AUTHENTICATION FLOW:
   - User clicks "Download" button
   - JavaScript gets access token
   - Sends authenticated request to backend
   - Backend verifies user permissions
   - File is downloaded with proper auth

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Frontend (messages/page.tsx):
- Button: onClick={() => handleFileDownload(message.file_url, message.file_name)}
- Function: Uses fetch() with Authorization header
- Download: Creates blob and triggers download

Backend (files.py):
- Maintains existing permission checking
- Supports ?download=true parameter
- Returns file with proper Content-Disposition headers

BEHAVIOR:
- Before: Direct link → Authentication error
- After: Button click → Authenticated download → Success

SECURITY:
- All downloads still require authentication
- File permissions still enforced
- No security compromises

SUCCESS!
File downloads now work with proper authentication!
