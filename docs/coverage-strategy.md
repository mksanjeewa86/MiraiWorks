## 📋 **Testing Patterns to Follow**

### **Service Testing Template**:
```python
class TestServiceName:
    """Comprehensive service tests."""

    # SUCCESS SCENARIOS
    async def test_create_success(self): pass
    async def test_update_success(self): pass
    async def test_delete_success(self): pass

    # ERROR SCENARIOS
    async def test_invalid_input(self): pass
    async def test_not_found(self): pass
    async def test_permission_denied(self): pass

    # INTEGRATION SCENARIOS
    async def test_external_service_integration(self): pass
    async def test_database_constraints(self): pass
```

### **Coverage Requirements by Component**:
| Component | Target Coverage | Current | Gap |
|-----------|----------------|---------|-----|
| **Models** | 95% | 85% | +10% |
| **Schemas** | 95% | 90% | +5% |
| **Services** | 80% | 25% | +55% |
| **Endpoints** | 80% | 35% | +45% |
| **CRUD** | 75% | 45% | +30% |
| **Utils** | 90% | 60% | +30% |

## 🔧 **CI/CD Configuration**

### **Current Settings** (Realistic):
- **CI Minimum**: 55% (allows current tests to pass)
- **PR Green**: 60% (good coverage)
- **PR Orange**: 50% (needs improvement)

### **Progressive Targets**:
- **Month 1**: 55% → 65%
- **Month 2**: 65% → 75%
- **Month 3**: 75% → 80%
- **Long-term**: 80%+ (production ready)

### **Commands**:
```bash
# Local coverage testing
PYTHONPATH=. python -m pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html

# Coverage for specific areas
PYTHONPATH=. python -m pytest --cov=app.services --cov-report=term-missing

# Run only high-priority service tests
PYTHONPATH=. python -m pytest app/tests/test_*service*.py -v
```
