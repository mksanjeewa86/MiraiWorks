# MiraiWorks Project Recommendations

## 1. Testing Priority Issues

Current test coverage is critically low (~28%). Immediate actions needed:

1. Fix pytest async fixture configuration issues that are blocking test execution
2. Prioritize testing of high-risk endpoints:
   - resumes.py (23 routes) - Critical priority
   - meetings.py (13 routes) - High complexity
   - interviews.py (11 routes) - High complexity

Action items:
- Resolve async fixture setup in conftest.py
- Implement missing test coverage for resumes API
- Follow test structure defined in CLAUDE.md
- Setup CI/CD pipeline with coverage reporting
