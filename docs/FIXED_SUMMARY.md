# Database Migration - Fixed Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-05
**Issue:** Migration failure due to pre-existing tables
**Resolution:** Successfully applied all changes

---

## What Was Broken

When running `alembic upgrade head`, the migration failed with:

```
sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (1050, "Table 'question_banks' already exists")
```

**Root Cause:**
- The `question_banks` and `question_bank_items` tables already existed in the database
- They were created in a previous attempt but with slightly different column names
- The migration tried to CREATE TABLE which failed

---

## How It Was Fixed

### Step 1: Stamp the Base Migration
```bash
alembic stamp 7b40e9699400
```
This marked the base migration as applied without running it, since the tables already existed.

### Step 2: Create New Migration for Missing Columns
```bash
alembic revision -m "add_missing_exam_workflow_columns"
```
Created migration: `504e237d4188_add_missing_exam_workflow_columns.py`

### Step 3: Add All Missing Changes
The new migration includes:

1. **Fix question_banks table**
   - Rename `created_by` → `created_by_id`

2. **Add source tracking to exam_questions**
   - source_type (VARCHAR(20))
   - source_bank_id (INT, FK)
   - source_question_id (INT, FK)
   - 2 indexes

3. **Add selection rules to exams**
   - question_selection_rules (JSON)

4. **Add exam fields to todos**
   - exam_id (INT, FK)
   - exam_assignment_id (INT, FK)
   - exam_config (JSON)
   - 2 indexes

5. **Add workflow fields to exam_assignments**
   - todo_id (INT, FK)
   - workflow_node_execution_id (INT, FK)
   - 2 indexes

6. **Create all foreign keys**
   - 6 foreign key constraints
   - All with ON DELETE SET NULL

### Step 4: Apply the Migration
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```
**Result:** ✅ Successfully applied all changes

## Verification

All changes verified and working:

### Columns Added
```
✅ exam_questions.source_type: True
✅ exam_questions.source_bank_id: True
✅ exam_questions.source_question_id: True
✅ exams.question_selection_rules: True
✅ todos.exam_id: True
✅ todos.exam_assignment_id: True
✅ todos.exam_config: True
✅ exam_assignments.todo_id: True
✅ exam_assignments.workflow_node_execution_id: True
✅ question_banks.created_by_id: True
✅ question_banks.created_by: False (removed)
```

### Foreign Keys Created
```
exam_questions:
  ✅ fk_exam_questions_source_bank → question_banks
  ✅ fk_exam_questions_source_question → question_bank_items

todos:
  ✅ fk_todos_exam → exams
  ✅ fk_todos_exam_assignment → exam_assignments

exam_assignments:
  ✅ fk_exam_assignments_todo → todos
  ✅ fk_exam_assignments_workflow_execution → workflow_node_executions
```

### Migration Status
```bash
$ alembic current
504e237d4188 (head)
```

Database is fully up to date.

## What This Enables

Now that the migration is complete, the system can:

1. **Track Question Sources**
   - Every exam question tracks its origin (custom, template, or question bank)
   - Full audit trail from question bank to exam

2. **Create Hybrid Exams**
   - Mix custom questions with randomly selected questions from banks
   - Store selection rules for reproducibility

3. **Integrate Exams into Workflows**
   - Exams can be assigned as TODO items
   - Bidirectional linking: Todo ↔ ExamAssignment ↔ WorkflowNodeExecution

4. **Auto-Complete Workflow**
   - When candidate completes exam, TODO auto-completes
   - Workflow automatically advances to next node

## Migration Files

1. **Base Migration (Stamped)**
   - `7b40e9699400_add_question_banks_and_exam_workflow_.py`
   - Status: Stamped without execution

2. **Applied Migration**
   - `504e237d4188_add_missing_exam_workflow_columns.py`
   - Status: Successfully applied
   - Contains all actual database changes

---

## Rollback Available

If needed, rollback with:
```bash
alembic downgrade 7b40e9699400
```

This will safely remove all added columns and foreign keys.

---

## Summary

✅ **Migration Fixed**
✅ **All Columns Added**
✅ **All Foreign Keys Created**
✅ **All Indexes Created**
✅ **Database Verified**
✅ **System Ready for Testing**

The exam workflow system is now fully deployed and ready for functional testing.

**Status:** COMPLETE
**Next Step:** Test API endpoints and workflow integration
