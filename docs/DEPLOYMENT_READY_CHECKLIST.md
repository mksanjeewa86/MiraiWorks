## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### **Step 1: Backup Database** üî¥ CRITICAL
```bash
# Create backup before migration
mysqldump -u user -p miraiworks > backup_before_exam_workflow_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# Verify backup file exists and has content
ls -lh backup_before_exam_workflow_*.sql
```

### **Step 2: Run Migration** ‚úÖ COMPLETE
```bash
cd backend
python -m alembic upgrade head
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ SUCCESSFULLY APPLIED

**Actual Output:**
```
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Running upgrade 7b40e9699400 -> 504e237d4188, add_missing_exam_workflow_columns
```

### **Step 3: Verify Migration** ‚úÖ COMPLETE
```bash
python -m alembic current
# Shows: 504e237d4188 (head)
```

**All database changes verified:**
- ‚úÖ exam_questions: source_type, source_bank_id, source_question_id
- ‚úÖ exams: question_selection_rules
- ‚úÖ todos: exam_id, exam_assignment_id, exam_config
- ‚úÖ exam_assignments: todo_id, workflow_node_execution_id
- ‚úÖ question_banks: created_by_id (renamed from created_by)
- ‚úÖ All foreign keys created
- ‚úÖ All indexes created

### **Step 4: Verify Database Schema**
```sql
-- Verify question_banks table
DESCRIBE question_banks;

-- Verify question_bank_items table
DESCRIBE question_bank_items;

-- Verify exam_questions columns
SHOW COLUMNS FROM exam_questions WHERE Field IN ('source_type', 'source_bank_id', 'source_question_id');

-- Verify exams columns
SHOW COLUMNS FROM exams WHERE Field = 'question_selection_rules';

-- Verify todos columns
SHOW COLUMNS FROM todos WHERE Field IN ('exam_id', 'exam_assignment_id', 'exam_config');

-- Verify exam_assignments columns
SHOW COLUMNS FROM exam_assignments WHERE Field IN ('todo_id', 'workflow_node_execution_id');
```

### **Step 5: Restart Backend**
```bash
# Stop current backend
# Start backend with new code
# Verify no startup errors
```

### **Step 6: Test API Endpoints**

#### Test 1: Create Global Question Bank (System Admin)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/question-banks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SYSTEM_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "SPI Verbal Reasoning Test",
    "description": "Standard SPI verbal aptitude questions",
    "exam_type": "spi",
    "category": "verbal",
    "difficulty": "medium",
    "is_public": true,
    "questions": [
      {
        "question_text": "Choose the word that best completes the sentence",
        "question_type": "multiple_choice",
        "order_index": 1,
        "points": 5.0,
        "time_limit_seconds": 60,
        "options": ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"],
        "correct_answers": ["Option A"],
        "difficulty": "medium",
        "category": "verbal"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

**Expected Response:** Status 200, question bank created with ID

#### Test 2: List Question Banks
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/question-banks?exam_type=spi" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

**Expected Response:** Status 200, list of SPI question banks

#### Test 3: Create Hybrid Exam
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/exams/hybrid \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "exam_data": {
      "title": "Company SPI Test",
      "description": "10 custom + 20 from SPI bank",
      "exam_type": "spi",
      "time_limit_minutes": 60,
      "total_points": 150,
      "passing_score": 90,
      "company_id": 1
    },
    "custom_questions": [
      {
        "question_text": "Custom company question 1",
        "question_type": "multiple_choice",
        "order_index": 1,
        "points": 5.0,
        "options": ["A", "B", "C", "D"],
        "correct_answers": ["A"]
      }
    ],
    "template_selections": [
      {
        "bank_id": 1,
        "count": 20,
        "category": "verbal",
        "difficulty": "medium"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

**Expected Response:** Status 200, hybrid exam created with 30 questions (10 custom + 20 from bank)

#### Test 4: Create Workflow with Exam TODO
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/workflows \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "SPI Assessment Workflow",
    "nodes": [
      {
        "title": "Complete SPI Test",
        "node_type": "todo",
        "order_index": 1,
        "config": {
          "todo_type": "exam",
          "exam_config": {
            "exam_type": "spi",
            "due_date": "2025-01-20T00:00:00Z",
            "custom_time_limit_minutes": 60
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }'
```

**Expected Response:** Status 200, workflow created
