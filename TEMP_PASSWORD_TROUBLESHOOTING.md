## üîç **Detailed Troubleshooting Steps**

### **Step 1: Verify the Email**

Check your activation email for these elements:
```
Subject: Activate your MiraiWorks Account
Content should include:
- Your name
- Activation URL (like: /activate/123)
- Temporary password (usually 12 characters, mixed case + numbers)
```

### **Step 2: Test Password Characters**

**Valid temporary password characters:**
- ‚úÖ Uppercase letters: A-Z
- ‚úÖ Lowercase letters: a-z
- ‚úÖ Numbers: 0-9
- ‚ùå Special symbols: NOT included in temporary passwords

**Example valid temporary password:** `aB3cD4eF5gH6`

### **Step 3: Manual Entry Process**

1. **Clear the field completely**
2. **Click the eye icon üëÅÔ∏è to show password**
3. **Type each character carefully**
4. **Compare with email character by character**
5. **Ensure no trailing spaces**

### **Step 4: Check User Account Status**

The user account must be in the correct state:
- ‚úÖ Account created but not yet activated (`is_active = False`)
- ‚úÖ Temporary password recently generated
- ‚ùå Account already activated
- ‚ùå Account suspended or deleted

## üõ† **Advanced Debugging**

### **If You're Still Having Issues:**

#### **Option 1: Request New Temporary Password**
Ask your administrator to:
1. Reset your temporary password
2. Send a new activation email
3. Verify the email delivery

#### **Option 2: Check Database (Admin Only)**
```sql
-- Check user status
SELECT id, email, is_active, created_at, updated_at
FROM users
WHERE email = 'your-email@domain.com';

-- Verify password was set recently
SELECT id, email, updated_at
FROM users
WHERE email = 'your-email@domain.com'
AND updated_at > NOW() - INTERVAL 1 DAY;
```

#### **Option 3: Backend Logs (Admin Only)**
Check for these log entries:
```
"Invalid temporary password" - means password verification failed
"User not found" - means email/user ID mismatch
"Account already activated" - means user is already active
```

## üîß **Common Fixes**

### **Fix 1: Email Display Issues**

**If your email shows the password like this:**
```
Password: abc123XYZ (but looks weird or truncated)
```

**Try:**
- View source of the email
- Copy from plain text version
- Contact admin for password via different method

### **Fix 2: Browser Issues**

**If browser seems to interfere:**
```javascript
// Clear browser storage (in console)
localStorage.clear();
sessionStorage.clear();
```

**Or use incognito mode**

### **Fix 3: Mobile/App Issues**

**If using mobile or email app:**
- Switch to desktop browser
- Open email in web browser instead of app
- Zoom in to see password clearly

## üìß **Email Template Issues**

### **What to Look For in Your Email:**

```html
<!-- Good email format -->
<p>Your temporary password is: <strong>aB3cD4eF5gH6</strong></p>

<!-- Or in plain text -->
Temporary Password: aB3cD4eF5gH6
```

### **Red Flags:**
- Password shown as: `[HIDDEN]` or `****`
- Password with unusual characters: `@#$%^&*`
- Password shorter than 12 characters
- Password with spaces in the middle
