# ATS (Applicant Tracking System) Feature Plan

## ðŸš€ Implementation Approach: RULE-BASED (No AI/ML)

## Overview
Add ATS functionality to MiraiWorks platform with two premium features using rule-based algorithms:

### 1. Resume Screening for Employers (`resume_ats_screening`)
- **Rule-based** resume analysis and candidate screening
- Skills extraction and matching (using predefined dictionaries)
- Experience scoring and ranking (statistical analysis)
- Keyword matching with job descriptions (pattern matching)
- ATS compatibility checks (format validation)
- Batch candidate analysis

### 2. Resume Optimization for Candidates (`resume_ats_optimization`)
- Resume quality scoring (0-100 scale, weighted formulas)
- Actionable improvement suggestions (template-based)
- Keyword optimization for target roles (dictionary matching)
- ATS compatibility checks (rule-based validation)
- Content recommendations per section (predefined rules)
- Progress tracking over time

## Implementation Status
ðŸ“‹ **Planning Phase Complete - Rule-Based Approach**

**Detailed Implementation Plan**:
- ðŸ“˜ `docs/ATS_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Full specifications
- ðŸ“˜ `docs/ATS_RULE_BASED_ALGORITHMS.md` - Algorithm details

## Key Benefits
- âœ… No external API costs (no OpenAI, no spaCy)
- âœ… Fast processing (< 500ms per resume)
- âœ… Privacy-friendly (no data sent externally)
- âœ… Predictable results
- âœ… No rate limits
- âœ… Complete control over logic

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: Backend Foundation (Week 1) - Database models, schemas
- **Phase 2**: Service Layer (Week 2) - Rule-based scoring algorithms
- **Phase 3**: API Layer (Week 3) - Endpoints, permissions
- **Phase 4**: Premium Features (Week 3) - Feature gating, subscriptions
- **Phase 5**: Frontend (Week 4) - UI components, TypeScript types
- **Phase 6**: Testing (Week 5) - Unit, integration, E2E tests

**Total Estimated Time**: 4-5 weeks for MVP (reduced - no AI integration needed)

## Key Features
- âœ… Resume quality scoring
- âœ… Skills extraction and matching
- âœ… Job-resume matching
- âœ… Optimization suggestions
- âœ… ATS compatibility checks
- âœ… Keyword analysis
- âœ… Batch analysis
- âœ… Analysis history tracking

## Premium Configuration
- Free Plan: No ATS features
- Basic Plan: 5 optimizations/month
- Professional Plan: Unlimited optimizations, 20 screenings/month
- Enterprise Plan: Unlimited everything + batch analysis

## Next Steps
1. Review and approve `docs/ATS_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
2. Begin Phase 1: Database models and schemas
3. Set up AI/ML integration (OpenAI API)
4. Create Alembic migration
5. Implement service layer logic
