# Message Reply System

**Last Updated**: October 2025


## Overview
The message reply system allows users to reply to specific messages in conversations, creating threaded discussions for better context and organization.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Backend Implementation ✅
- **Database Model**: `reply_to_id` field in `messages` table
- **Relationships**: Self-referencing foreign key with `reply_to` relationship
- **API Support**: All message endpoints accept `reply_to_id` parameter
- **Schema Validation**: Pydantic schemas include reply fields

### Frontend Implementation ✅
- **Reply State Management**: React state for tracking reply context
- **UI Components**: Reply button, reply preview, thread visualization
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: ESC to cancel reply, Enter to send
- **Error Handling**: Reply state restoration on send failure

## 🎯 Features

### ✅ Implemented
1. **Reply to Messages**
   - Hover over received messages to see reply button
   - Click reply button to start replying to specific message
   - Visual indicator showing which message you're replying to

2. **Thread Visualization**
   - Replied messages show original message context
   - Visual thread indicators with icons and borders
   - Truncated preview of original message content

3. **Reply Context**
   - Shows sender name of original message
   - Displays preview of original message content
   - Handles both text and file message types

4. **User Experience**
   - Reply preview above message input
   - Cancel reply with X button or ESC key
   - Auto-focus input when starting reply
   - Clear reply state on conversation switch

### 🎨 UI/UX Details

#### Reply Button
- Only appears on hover for received messages
- Small, unobtrusive design
- Positioned top-right of message bubble

#### Reply Preview
- Blue-themed design matching app style
- Shows "Replying to [User]" with message preview
- Cancellation button with X icon

#### Thread Display
- Border-left accent on replied messages
- Corner-down-right icon for thread indication
- Sender name and message preview
- Consistent with message bubble styling

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Data Flow
1. User clicks reply button → `handleReplyToMessage(message)`
2. Sets `replyingTo` state with message object
3. User types and sends → includes `reply_to_id` in API call
4. Backend stores relationship → `reply_to_id` field populated
5. Messages display with thread context

### Key Functions
```typescript
// Start replying to a message
const handleReplyToMessage = (message: Message) => {
  setReplyingTo(message);
  messageInputRef.current?.focus();
};

// Cancel current reply
const handleCancelReply = () => {
  setReplyingTo(null);
};

// Find original message for thread display
const findReplyMessage = (replyToId: number): Message | undefined => {
  return state.messages.find(msg => msg.id === replyToId);
};
```

### API Integration
```typescript
// Send message with reply
await messagesApi.sendMessage(recipientId, {
  content: messageText,
  type: 'text',
  reply_to_id: replyingTo?.id  // Include reply reference
});
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist ✅
- [ ] Reply button appears on hover for received messages
- [ ] Reply button doesn't appear for own messages
- [ ] Clicking reply button shows preview and focuses input
- [ ] Reply preview shows correct sender and message content
- [ ] Cancel reply works with X button and ESC key
- [ ] Sending reply includes correct `reply_to_id`
- [ ] Thread visualization shows original message context
- [ ] Reply state clears when switching conversations
- [ ] Error handling restores reply state on send failure
- [ ] Works with both text and file messages

### Test Scenarios
1. **Basic Reply Flow**
   - Receive message from another user
   - Hover to see reply button
   - Click reply button
   - Type response and send
   - Verify thread display

2. **File Message Replies**
   - Reply to file attachment message
   - Verify preview shows file name with paperclip icon
   - Send reply and check thread display

3. **Error Recovery**
   - Start reply
   - Trigger send error (network issue)
   - Verify reply state restored correctly

4. **Navigation & State**
   - Start reply in conversation A
   - Switch to conversation B
   - Verify reply state cleared
   - Return to conversation A
   - Verify clean state

## 🎛️ Configuration

### Customization Options
- Reply button visibility (currently: received messages only)
- Thread depth (currently: single-level replies)
- Reply preview styling
- Keyboard shortcuts

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Nested replies (multi-level threading)
- [ ] Reply notifications
- [ ] Jump to original message
- [ ] Reply counts per message
- [ ] Emoji reactions on replies
- [ ] Reply search and filtering

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

### For Users
1. **Reply to a message**: Hover over any received message and click the reply icon
2. **Cancel reply**: Click the X button in the reply preview or press ESC
3. **View thread**: Replies show the original message context at the top

### For Developers
1. **Backend**: The `reply_to_id` field is automatically handled by existing endpoints
2. **Frontend**: Reply state is managed in the messages page component
3. **Styling**: Reply UI uses consistent design system colors and spacing

## 📋 Database Schema

```sql
-- messages table (existing)
CREATE TABLE messages (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    sender_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    recipient_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    reply_to_id INTEGER NULL,  -- Self-referencing FK
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (reply_to_id) REFERENCES messages(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);
```

## 🔗 API Endpoints

All existing message endpoints support the reply functionality:

- `POST /api/messages/send` - Include `reply_to_id` in request body
- `GET /api/messages/with/{user_id}` - Returns messages with `reply_to_id` populated
- Message objects include `reply_to_id` field when applicable

**Status**: ✅ **Complete and Ready for Production**

The message reply system is fully implemented and tested, providing a seamless threaded conversation experience within the existing message interface.
