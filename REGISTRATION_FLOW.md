```
Admin-Set Password Requirements:
‚úì Same strict requirements as self-registration

‚úì Audit log for all admin actions
‚úì IP logging for admin operations
‚úì Two-factor authentication for admin accounts
‚úì Session timeout for admin panel
```

#### **Email Verification**
```
Best Practices:
- Skip verification for internal/trusted users only

- Send verification email even if account is active
- Log verification bypass in audit trail
```
